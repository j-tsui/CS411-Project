## Team members 
* [Chen Xu](https://github.com/chenyphg)
* [Jennifer Tsui](https://github.com/j-tsui)
* [Jiayuan Zheng](https://github.com/jiayuanz)
* [Lucas Arruda](https://github.com/larruda13)

## Running the software

Run `hello.py`. Note that we are developing with Python 3.5.2.
From there, the output should say something like this:

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

In this case, you would want to go to `http://localhost:5000/test` to run the code.
